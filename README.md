# Tower-defense

⚠️ This is a Work-in-progress, and is not usable yet

The goal of this tool is to post-process gcode files, in order to isolate "towers" that it can print multiple layers of one after the other, before going to the next tower, instead of doing everything layer-by-layer.

This will greatly enhance print speeds, by minimizing travels and retractions, as well as minimize stringing.
